Additionally, don't make comics to *\u201cintroduce\u201d* a new rageface|\n|NSFW tags are free|Please use NSFW tags for anything that might have the remote possibility of getting somone fired or in trouble|\n|Comics must be between 2 and 8 panels|Your comic must be between 2 and 8 panels long. We don't want single panels, nor do we want novels. No comics made of double-width panels only|\n|No blogposts|Blogposts are preachy, self-serving, boring comics. These often take the form of a full-panel stare face lecturing someone, posts about how your dog/cat/grandpa died, and similar. Your post must be *relatable*, not a personal anecdote|\n|No vote-begging|Do not mention cakedays, karma, upvotes, or anything similar|\n|Be light on text|People come here for quick, simple humor.
